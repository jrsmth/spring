# Using Swagger with Spring Boot
*Documentation for APIs*

<br>

## Overview
* What is Swagger?
    * Swagger is an OSS framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that assists developer in the design, build, documentation and consuming of RESTful web services
    * The aim of Swagger is to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a web service, without direct investigation - i.e. access to the source code, written documentation or network traffic inspection
* Motive for Swagger:
    * Prior RESTful APIs, SOAP web services were very common:
        * SOAP services could include a WSDL (Web Services Decription Layer) XML document that described the contract of the endpoint
        * REST has no formal WSDL and hence the rise of Swagger for documentation
